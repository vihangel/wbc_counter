    "neutrophilsDescription": "Neutrophils are immune defense cells that generally have segmented nuclei, with 2 to 5 segments connected by thin filaments. The color of the cytoplasm is slightly pink to colorless. They are the most abundant white cells, with medium size and shape rounded to slightly lobed. They may contain fine, pale granules, but they are usually not very visible. Neutrophils are highly motile and phagocytose bacteria.",
